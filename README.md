**U**ser e**X**perience focused **ID**entifiers (UXIDs) are identifiers which:

* Describe the resource (aid in debugging and investigation)
* Work well with copy and paste (double clicking selects the entire ID)
* Can be shortened for low cardinality resources
* Are secure against enumeration attacks
* Can be generated by application code (not tied to the datastore)
* Are K-sortable (lexicographically sortable by time - works well with datastore indexing)
* Do not require any coordination (human or automated) at startup, or generation
* Are very unlikely to collide (more likely with less randomness)
* Are easily and accurately transmitted to another human using a telephone

Many of the concepts of Stripe IDs have been used in this library.

## Usage

### Generating UXIDs

```elixir
# No options generates a basic ULID
UXID.generate! # "01emdgjf0dqxqj8fm78xe97y3h"

# A prefix can be provided
UXID.generate! prefix: "cus" # "cus_01emdgjf0dqxqj8fm78xe97y3h"

# The amount of randomness can be decreased for smaller cardinality resources
# T-Shirt sizes can be used (xs, s, m, l, xl) or (xsmall, small, medium, large, xlarge)
UXID.generate! prefix: "cus", size: :small # "cus_01eqrh884aqyy1"

# Uppercase can be used to match previous UXID versions
UXID.generate! case: :upper # "01EMDGJF0DQXQJ8FM78XE97Y3H"
```

### Ecto

UXIDs can be used as Ecto fields including primary keys.

```elixir
defmodule YourApp.User do
  use Ecto.Schema

  @primary_key {:id, UXID, autogenerate: true, prefix: "usr", size: :medium}
  schema "users" do
    field :api_key, UXID, autogenerate: true, prefix: "apikey", size: :small
    field :api_secret, UXID, autogenerate: true, prefix: "apisecret", size: :xlarge
  end
end
```

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `uxid` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:uxid, "~> 2.2"}
  ]
end
```
